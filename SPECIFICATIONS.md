# Smart Name Card Manager - Specification Document

## 1. Project Overview
**Project Name**: Smart Name Card Manager (Tentative)
**Objective**: A premium, AI-powered web application to digitize, organize, and actively monitor professional contacts. It features "Active Intelligence" to keep data fresh and provides flexible storage options (Database + Markdown) for easy indexing and portability.

## 2. Core Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Smart Input & Digitization
- **Multi-modal Input**:
  - **OCR from Images**: Upload photos of business cards. The system must extract Name, Title, Company, Email, Phone, Address, and Website.
  - **Manual Entry**: A sleek form for typing details.
  - **Bulk Import**: Support for CSV/JSON or drag-and-drop of multiple card images.
- **Auto-Correction**: During input, the system should standardize formatting (e.g., phone number formats, removing typos).

### 2.2 Organization & Management
- **Categorization**:
  - Tags/Groups (e.g., Client, Vendor, Partner).
  - "Date Added" tracking (Automatic).
- **Search & Filter**: Instant search by any field (Name, Company, Tags).

### 2.3 Active Monitoring & Data Enrichment (The "Smart" Layer)
- **Staleness Detection**: 
  - **Job Title/Unit auto-check**: Periodically verify if the person still holds the position (via web search/LinkedIn public availability verification).
  - **Auto-Tagging**: If a contact seems outdated (e.g., different title found online), automatically tag as "Potential Info Mismatch" or turn the card visual to "Greyscale".
- **Email Validation**: 
  - Syntax check.
  - Domain existence check (DNS query) to spot dead company domains.
- **Data Enrichment**: 
  - Attempt to fill in missing fields (e.g., finding the latest office address or company website if missing) using web search tools.

### 2.4 AI Intelligence & Valuation
- **Importance Analysis**:
  - Use an LLM to analyze the contact's title, company size (inferred), and user notes to assign an "Importance Score" or "Relevance Tier".
  - **Contextual Summary**: "Why is this person interesting to me?" (Generated by AI based on user profile and contact data).

## 3. User Experience (UX) & Design

### 3.1 Aesthetic Guideline: "Clean Modern" (Vercel/Linear Style)
-   **Color Palette**:
    -   Strictly monochromatic grayscale background (Slate-50 to Slate-900).
    -   **Accent**: Single vibrant color (e.g., Electric Blue or Violet) used *only* for primary actions (Buttons, Active States).
-   **Borders & Depth**:
    -   No heavy drop shadows. Use subtle 1px borders (`border-white/10`) to define edges.
    -   Use `backdrop-blur` for floating elements (Models, Sticky Headers) to maintain context.
-   **Spacing & Typography**:
    -   **Whitespace**: Significant padding (`p-6` or `p-8`) to let content breathe.
    -   **Font**: Tight sans-serif (Inter or Plus Jakarta Sans). High contrast between Headings (Bold, `tracking-tight`) and Body text.

### 3.2 Layout Strategy: "Bento Grid"
-   **Structure**:
    -   Content organized into modular, rectangular cards (rounded-2xl).
    -   Strict alignment to a responsive grid system.
-   **Card Style**:
    -   Subtle localized background colors (e.g., `bg-white/5`) contrasting slightly with the main background.
    -   **Micro-interactions**: Cards should have a subtle hover effect (e.g., proper border color change, slight scale `scale-[1.02]`, smooth `transition-all`).
-   **Inputs**: Minimalist. No background (or transparent), minimal border, clean focus ring.

## 4. Technical Architecture & Data Strategy

### 4.1 Local-First Storage Model
To satisfy the need for local control and easy indexing (Obsidian/Finder), we will use a **Local-First** approach:
1.  **Primary Data Store (Application State)**:
    -   **Technology**: **Local JSON File** (`data/contacts.json`).
    -   **Reason**: Fast, lightweight, and zero-setup. Perfect for keeping the app responsive and storing app-specific metadata (last checked timestamp, AI score).
2.  **Markdown Mirror (The "Obsidian" Layer)**:
    -   **Feature**: **Auto-Sync to Markdown**.
    -   **Function**: Whenever a contact is added/updated, the system writes a `.md` file to the `Cards/` directory.
    -   **Format**: Obsidian-compatible Frontmatter (YAML) + Content.
    -   **Benefit**: You can open the project folder directly in **Obsidian** to see your network graph and notes.

### 4.2 Integrations
-   **Obsidian**: Native support via the Markdown Mirror (Project folder = Obsidian Vault).
-   **Notion**: (Future Feature) Optional 1-way sync to push contacts to a Notion Database via API.

### 4.3 Tech Stack
-   **Frontend**: Next.js (React) + Vanilla CSS (Premium Glassmorphism UI).
-   **Backend Logic**: Next.js API Routes (Serverless functions running locally) to handle file writes (JSON/Markdown) and API calls.
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API (GPT-4o) for:
  - OCR (Vision capabilities).
  - Relevance analysis.
  - Formatting correction.
- **External Tools Integration**:
  - Web Search API (for verification).
  - DNS Lookup.

## 5. Implementation Roadmap
1.  **Phase 1: Foundation & Data**: Next.js + Local JSON + Markdown Mirror.
2.  **Phase 2: "Clean Modern" UI**: Implement Bento Grid dashboard, Vercel-like aesthetics, and bilingual OCR form.
3.  **Phase 3: Obsidian Sync**: Ensure Markdown output is rich with metadata (tags, summary).
4.  **Phase 4: AI Enrichment**: Bilingual Job Title translation and Company background generation.
5.  **Phase 5: Active Monitoring**: Bot to verify email domains validity.

## 6. Questions for User
- **LLM Provider**: Do you have an OpenAI API key (or similar) ready for us to use for the AI features?
